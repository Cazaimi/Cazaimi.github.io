I know that the title of this post is clich√© to anyone who has ever written a computer program. That said, it fits. This is my first post on this platform and with it I would like to give you a primer on why I'm doing this. 

## What is this about?

All these posts are about the stuff that I discover as I go through. These can include, but are not limited to the following parallels:

- Tech
- Career direction
- Self help
- Health and wellness, etc.

Each of these posts are about one such topic. A topic may be big enough to fit in not one but many posts. On the other hand, no topic I feel, is so shallow, as to not require even a full single post. 

### Format

I do not want to keep these posts too lengthy, believe me, I have lesser patience then you do. üòÖ

Hence, these posts would not require more than 10-15 mins to read, which would place it at about 2000-3000 words per post. I believe I should be able to discuss any topic within this limit. A hackneyed quote, but relevant:

## What do I get out of it?

Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize winning physicist who gave birth to the <a href='https://curiosity.com/topics/learn-anything-in-four-steps-with-the-feynman-technique-curiosity/' target='about:blank'>Feynman technique</a>. He was famous for his ability to explain complicated concepts to people who had very little to no context about them. The technique is as follows:

> If you take up explaining any concept/idea to another person, you will find gaps withing your own understanding.

If we try to apply this, then I _am_ explaining a concept to you. In fact, I am doing it right now, and this should illuminate gaps that I myself have in the understanding of it. So, by discussing a topic with you, in this format, I want to achieve the following:

- A more thorough understanding of the topic myself
- Better retention of the topic, so that I am able to apply it fluidly

## What do _you_ get out of it?

I am sure that you or even myself do not have the time to make an attempt to gather the thoroughgoing of another person's life. That is not the objective. The point is to gather perspective. I intend to keep the format that I use to discuss these topics here relatively high in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid' target='about:blank'>knowledge hierarchy</a>, which means to say that the text here is processed and analyzed. The ideas are not just plain information/data, but are knowledge and possibly wisdom, although I don't think I am qualified enough for that. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is the standard that I want to hold myself to. If not high knowledge hierarchy, then in the very least, you might be able to take away some reference! 

## Frequency 

I intend to write a post every 1-2 weeks. I should hold myself to the notion that I *will* not take more than 2 weeks to study a given topic and compose a corresponding post.

## Fears and practicalities

I fear that I will stop this practice midway. Anything new routine is easy to follow at the start by virtue of its novelty and our sheer enthusiasm. However, as time goes on, our enthusiasm becomes moderated in effect and we start to forget the nuances of thought that we possessed at the start, which compelled us to start this. üò©

Hence, this post should serve as an anchor in moments of doubt, and let's face it, laziness.

See you soon.

#### Cheers, Anmol
