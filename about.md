# About me

I am Ano and I like software. _You already know that_.

<!-- I am passionate about technology in general. That might be a generic thing to say, but it's true. -->

I am interested in design and using software to solve problems. I like to fit different things together to create something new altogether, something that's greater than the sum of it's parts. That's what is so interesting about puzzles/problem solving!  

Apart from software, I love music and you'd find me grooving any time during the day with a pair of headphones on.

I have owned:

- Bose QC 45 Headphones
- Airpods Pro 
- Bose QC Headphones
