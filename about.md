# About me

I am Anmol and I like software. _You already know that_.

I am passionate about technology in general. That might be a generic thing to say, but it's true.

I am interested in design and using software to solve problems. I like to fit different things together to create something new altogether, something that's greater than the sum of it's parts. That's what is so interesting about puzzles/problem solving! To that end, I work and engage my intellect. That is it's purpose.

Apart from software, I love music and you'd find me grooving any time during the day with a pair of headphones on.
